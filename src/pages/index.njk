    <h2 id="home-faq-heading">Not sure where to start?</h2>
    <p>These quick answers help you decide whether to begin with painting or roofing. Our team is always happy to hop on a call for tailored guidance.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="home-faq__items">
    <details>
      <summary>Should I book painting or roofing first?</summary>
      <p>If you have active leaks or storm damage, start with roofing so the envelope is watertight. Interior painting can follow once repairs are complete. For cosmetic updates only, our painting crew can begin right away.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Do you help with color and material selections?</summary>
      <p>Yes. Painting clients receive color consultation and sheen recommendations, while roofing projects include shingle, metal, or gutter material guidance matched to HOA and insurance requirements.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can one project cover both painting and roofing?</summary>
      <p>Absolutely. We coordinate schedules so exterior painting follows shortly after roofing work, ensuring proper cure times and a cohesive finish.</p>
