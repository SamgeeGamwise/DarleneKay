  <h2>Why Remove Popcorn Ceilings?</h2>
  <p>
    Popular in the 1970s and 80s, popcorn ceilings (also called acoustic or stipple ceilings) were once an inexpensive way 
    to hide imperfections and reduce noise. Today, they’re considered outdated, hard to clean, and in many cases unsafe due to asbestos concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you’re updating your home’s look, preparing for resale, or concerned about safety, professional popcorn ceiling removal is the right choice.
