<!-- WHY GUTTERS MATTER -->
<section class="overview container container-medium">
  <div class="overview__text">
    <h2>Why Your Gutters Matter</h2>
    <p>
      Gutters aren’t just trim pieces — they protect your siding, landscaping, and foundation. 
      Without proper drainage, Colorado’s downpours and snowmelt can cause erosion, cracked foundations, 
      and water intrusion into basements and crawl spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Darlene Kay, we install seamless gutters that move water efficiently, 
      reduce leaks, and add lasting value to your home.

<!-- SIGNS YOU NEED NEW GUTTERS -->
<section class="signs container container-small">
  <h2>Signs Your Gutters Need Attention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Water spilling over the sides during rainstorms</li>
    <li>Peeling paint, wood rot, or stains on siding</li>
    <li>Sagging or detached gutter sections</li>
    <li>Pooling water around your home’s foundation</li>
    <li>Rust spots, cracks, or visible holes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you notice any of these, it’s time to have your gutters inspected before the damage gets worse.

<!-- FAQ -->
<section class="faq container container-small">
  <h2>Gutter FAQs</h2>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Why is gutter repair important?</h3>
    <p>
      Damaged gutters let water back up onto your roof or down to your foundation, leading to leaks, 
      rot, and even basement flooding. Small repairs now prevent expensive fixes later.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How often should gutters be cleaned in Colorado?</h3>
    <p>
      Twice a year is best — once in spring and once in fall. 
      Homes with trees close by may need more frequent cleaning.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What are seamless gutters?</h3>
    <p>
      Seamless gutters are cut from a single piece of metal, meaning no seams along the run. 
      Fewer seams mean fewer leaks and a more polished look for your home.
    </p>

    <h3>Do you offer gutter guards?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, we can install guards to keep out leaves and debris, reducing maintenance and preventing clogs.
