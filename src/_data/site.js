We moved into a new house and they matched existing paint perfectly and absolutely transformed our baseboards. Perfect lines, perfect color matching, just amazing job.

Roy and his crew did outstanding work painting the interior of our home. They showed up on time, left on time, and did high quality work. Roy is an outstanding communicator and made sure that we were happy with every detail of the job. I’ve hired this company on various occasions and always had a good experience.' },

The quote was comprehensive and easy to understand, I was given multiple options to choose from and there was no deviation from what was agreed upon and the final results. It's nice to work with honest people, 5 stars is not enough..." },
    // { reviewer: "John Washburn", stars: 5, text: 'Marvelous experience! Darlene, Roy,Tyler and all were beyond great! Tyler did an awesome job with our drywall repair, it's seamless. Darlene took great care to ensure we really liked the color she helped us select even reaching out in between the process to make sure we saw it in all the possible lighting. In all, the painting job was complete very quickly and no touch ups needed. \nThanks again Darlene Kay Painting" },
    // { reviewer: "Meredith Gindi", stars: 5, text: 'I have never worked with a painting company who cared so much about the outcome of my job. The entire experience was great from the first meeting to the day the job was complete. And it isn't over because I don't like the paint color! No problem for these guys! They are the nicest people you could hope to work with! We worked it out and we'll repaint in a couple of weeks. They will be my in house painters from now on. And they're a family run business which makes it all that's much better." },
    // { reviewer: "Alexander Roberts", stars: 5, text: 'Skilled, honest, upright, and very polite. They did a great job from start to finish. One thing I really liked was that they listened to their music on ear buds. No loud music playing. Some times we have had workers who played loud and objectionable music. These folks are very considerate." },
    // { reviewer: "Sharon Spurrier", stars: 5, text: 'This company is Amazing! They are very particular about everything, making sure you are satisfied with their work.
